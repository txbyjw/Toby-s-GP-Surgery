This is an in-development build of my GP Surgery Simulation.

Currently this only contains the Patient and Doctor classes, the others are still being worked on.

To install, extract "Program" to your computer (probably desktop), open the folder, open "bin", "Debug", "net7.0", and then run "Program.exe".

Any information you add should be saved if you quit and return to the program at a later date.
